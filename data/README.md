# Initial Datasets to Develop Software and Database
## Manuscripts.xlsx & Samples.xlsx
Metadata descriptions for each of the files columns are embedded within the column name. Rows in the manuscripts file are unique manuscripts the data originated from. Rows in the samples file are unique samples within the manuscripts. Files can be linked using the DOI of the manuscript. Nested data is described with semicolons in cells. Where data was unavailable or unknown N/A is provided.
