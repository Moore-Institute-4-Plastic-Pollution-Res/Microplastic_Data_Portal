# Overview
This software supports the implementation of policy X which mandates sharing of microplastic data from drinking water, policy x which mandates that data be open access, and policy x which mandates that software be open by default. Our vision is to use this project as a framework for future software development in by state agencies in the California. All engagement on this open repo will be the subject of future policy research on how government and open source communities can better collaborate on software development projects.
